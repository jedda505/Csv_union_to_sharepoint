# Csv_union_to_sharepoint
An application pipeline to unzip password protected csv files, unionize the data and drop off in a folder to be uploaded to sharepoint.

Using a tkinter GUI, it prompts the user for a days input, picks up zip files that are date labelled for the number of dates inputted by the user. 

It unzips the password protected zip files and unionises them before dropping them off as a single CSV file in a folder so that they can be uploaded to sharepoint.
